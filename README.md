# GenerateArea is deprecated!
GenerateArea is deprecated and no longer supported. Please note that GeneratePanel, the successor to GenerateArea, has not been officially released yet and is currently in development. We apologize for any confusion.

GenerateArea and GeneratePanel are both client areas designed to assist with specific functions:

- **GenerateArea** was the original client area, but it is no longer actively developed or maintained. It is recommended to consider using GeneratePanel once it becomes available for an improved experience and ongoing support.

- **GeneratePanel** is the upcoming successor to GenerateArea and is currently in development by the developers at <a href="https://github.com/GenerateApps/GeneratePanel">here</a>. While it may not be available at this time, it is expected to offer enhanced features and improved functionality when it is released.

We appreciate your patience, and we encourage you to keep an eye on the official <a href="https://github.com/GenerateApps/GeneratePanel">GeneratePanel repository</a> for updates on its release date. In the meantime, if you need a client area solution, the archived version of GenerateArea is available for use.

<b>If you still wish to download GenerateArea, you can access the archived version by visiting <a href="https://github.com/GenerateApps/GenerateArea-archive">our archived version repository</a>.</b>
